# HR Mangement App

## System Overview

You are first directed to the login page where an `employee`, `HR manager`, and `admin` can login into the system

The user can click to the sign up button and new employees can signup using the sign up page, 

If the admin logs into the system, it will be directed to the admin dashboard, here it can check the attendance of the employees as well

The admin can delete as well as change the role of the employees from employees to HR and vice versa.

IF an HR logs into the system, it will be redirected to the HR dashboard 

The HR can assign new tasks to the employees 

The HR can see the list of tasks assigned to the employees

IF an employee logs into the system it is redirected to the employee dashboard, here it can check the list of the tasks assigned to it and change the status of the task as well.

The app has been made using HTML, CSS, JavaScript and then connected to the backend using the api
 - nodejs with expressjs is used which gives us many additional features to build a more functional backend
 - localstorage has been used to save the user information in the browser.
